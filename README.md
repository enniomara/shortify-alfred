# Shortify - Alfred

This is an [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) (tested on v3) workflow that
allows searching [shortify](https://github.com/enniomara/shortify).

This workflow shows all shortcuts stored in
[shortify](https://github.com/enniomara/shortify).

## Installation

Install it by downloading the `.workflow` file from the
[releases](https://github.com/enniomara/shortify-alfred/releases) page.

## Initialization

1. Change the `shortify_url` environment variable by using the Alfred GUI. Set
it to the shortify URL (e.g. `https://shortify.example.org`).

2. Run `sh-update` to retrieve the entries from the service.

3. Run `sh` to list the saved entries.
